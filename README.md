# Customized VS Code with Built-In Wingman AI

This repository includes a customized build of Visual Studio Code with Wingman AI integrated directly as a native component. It launches automatically on first run, is not listed among user-installable extensions, and cannot be removed via the standard Extensions panel.

---



 Wingman AI is embedded within the application and starts without user intervention.
 It is hidden from the Marketplace and the Extensions sidebar.
Full VS Code functionality remains unaffected.
Upgrade process is documented for future maintenance.
 A demo recording highlights the build behavior and integration.
